---

## 📦 Setup Instructions

### Requirements

- Python 3.x installed

## 🖼️ Screenshots (Coming Soon)

You’ll see:

- A form to input website, email/username, and password
- Buttons to save, view, delete all, or delete one
- Saved passwords shown in a separate pop-up window

---

## 🧠 How It Works

- Passwords are saved in a local `passwords.txt` file in the format:
```
Website | Username | Password
```
- No encryption (yet), so don’t use this for sensitive stuff.
- UI pops a message if fields are missing or after successful actions.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This app is meant for **educational/demo use only**. It stores passwords as plain text.  
If you're serious about security, look into **encryption**, **password hashing**, and **secure storage**.
